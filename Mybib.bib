  abstract =      {The thickness of the cerebral cortex can provide
                   valuable information about normal and abnormal
                   neuroanatomy. High resolution MRI together with
                   powerful image processing techniques has made it
                   possible to perform these measurements automatically
                   over the whole brain. Here we present a method for
                   automatically generating voxel-based cortical
                   thickness (VBCT) maps. This technique results in maps
                   where each voxel in the grey matter is assigned a
                   thickness value. Sub-voxel measurements of thickness
                   are possible using sub-sampling and interpolation of
                   the image information. The method is applied to
                   repeated MRI scans of a single subject from two MRI
                   scanners to demonstrate its robustness and
                   reproducibility. A simulated data set is used to show
                   that small focal differences in thickness between two
                   groups of subjects can be detected. We propose that
                   the analysis of VBCT maps can provide results that
                   are complementary to other anatomical analyses such
                   as voxel-based morphometry.},

  abstract =      {We briefly describe a set of algorithms to detect and
                   visualize effects of disease and genetic factors on
                   the brain. Extreme variations in cortical anatomy,
                   even among normal subjects, complicate the detection
                   and mapping of systematic effects on brain structure
                   in human populations. We tackle this problem in two
                   stages. First, we develop a cortical pattern matching
                   approach, based on metrically covariant partial
                   differential equations (PDEs), to associate
                   corresponding regions of cortex in an MRI brain image
                   database (N=102 scans). Second, these
                   high-dimensional deformation maps are used to
                   transfer within-subject cortical signals, including
                   measures of gray matter distribution, shape
                   asymmetries, and degenerative rates, to a common
                   anatomic template for statistical analysis. We
                   illustrate these techniques in two applications: (1)
                   mapping dynamic patterns of gray matter loss in
                   longitudinally scanned Alzheimer's disease patients;
                   and (2) mapping genetic influences on brain
                   structure. We extend statistics used widely in
                   behavioral genetics to cortical manifolds.
                   Specifically, we introduce methods based on h-squared
                   distributed random fields to map hereditary
                   influences on brain structure in human populations.},

  abstract =      {We present a novel, computerized method of examining
                   cerebral cortical thickness. The normal cortex varies
                   in thickness from 2 to 4 mm, reflecting the
                   morphology of neuronal sublayers. Cortical
                   pathologies often manifest abnormal variations in
                   thickness, with examples of Alzheimer's disease and
                   cortical dysplasia as thin and thick cortex,
                   respectively. Radiologically, images are 2-D slices
                   through a highly convoluted 3-D object. Depending on
                   the relative orientation of the slices with respect
                   to the object, it is impossible to deduce abnormal
                   cortical thickness without additional information
                   from neighboring slices. We approach the problem by
                   applying Laplace's Equation (V2psi = 0) from
                   mathematical physics. The volume of the cortex is
                   represented as the domain for the solution of the
                   differential equation, with separate boundary
                   conditions at the gray-white junction and the
                   gray-CSF junction. Normalized gradients of psi form a
                   vector field, representing tangent vectors along
                   field lines connecting both boundaries. We define the
                   cortical thickness at any point in the cortex to be
                   the pathlength along such lines. Key advantages of
                   this method are that it is fully three-dimensional,
                   and the thickness is uniquely defined for any point
                   in the cortex. We present graphical results that map
                   cortical thickness everywhere in a normal brain.
                   Results show global variations in cortical thickness
                   consistent with known neuroanatomy. The application
                   of this technique to visualization of cortical
                   thickness in brains with known pathology has broad
                   clinical implications.},
